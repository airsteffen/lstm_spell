"Things take a turn for the worse"
"Send him back where he came from"
"We got shots fired down the street"
Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then {*AHEM*}
Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy federalies yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stretches
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood
"Villain"
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cageYea, that's right
It's not a Hardy Boy mystery neither
This is real shit
This shit come on right after Hart to Hart y'all
No doubt, 7 o'clock Fantasy Island
This episode is "Death to a Brooklyn Man"
This is Tony's Angels
It was three white bitches who worked for Tony Starks
Undercover agents, far beyond narcs
Amazed by their beauty marks, Wonder Woman bracelets
Knee-high boots that was made by Clarks
My dick got hard at how they spoke and shit
Every language was music to the kid as if
I was modern day King Midas, Doreen, Skye and Kelly
Starky's Angels, Shaolin's finest
Though it happened in the streets of Brooklyn
Plus I played the whip real low cause my face was woofin'
My Angels jetted out of Albee Square
Gun out, wrap in their hair, kinda crowded so they clap in the air
Chased a nigga down block for block, squeezing Glocks
These mommies real angels took one off his top
He's a rapist, murderer, convict, burglar
The more they ran the more their skirts got dirtier
Sending shots like check day, Fed Ex expressway
Boom bow bing, you heard the gunplay
"Who shot that duck out the window", Mr. Lee said
"Three pay now, you fucking weed head"
We can stop the finest suspect, he's dead
Then I pulled up, "Come on girls to Club Med"
Stay tuned for the conclusion
Three's Company Family Jewels
Two brown sisters assisted the Villain, DOOM
He woke up stoked like they was still in the room
Freed his right arm and leg, it was more like a sweep
Release his other leg, arm, head and rose to his feet
Staggering except for the socks and mask, naked
Threw on the boxers, searching for the Treo
Checkin' for the keys, the dough
A robbery expected, yet nothing obvious is missing
Recollected now why Hollywood hotties stepped in Giuseppe Zanotti's
Personnel nurses, Chanel purses, CLK shottie
Chasing Patrice with Thai iced teas
She drive while nice to veggie fried rice spicy
Told them both, I don't feel so well, my belly
Spin me down Melrose, drive me to the telly
Y'all go head and get the dutches, be back copy
Feeling woozy, no uzi, who's he see in the lobby
Peace, Peace, pizza man, change a hundred, stopped and looked
Whoops, left the knot in her pocket book
Wasn't the juks but too careless fearless
Got to the room and fell flat out on the terrace
The question remains who bound and gagged him
That's when they found the empty pack of black Magnum
Villains skied a gram on the street, fifty G
The part of Mr. Roper was played by Mr. THMMMM
The flow is toe in, precision as an afro trim
All big letters but isn't no acronym
Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
DDT the first bar, leave this track back broken
Chrome grown man doing business with anglo-sax'n'them
Lacking swing but that banjo's so relaxing
As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind
Pretend it's just a pen, see if you can pencil 'em in
Tense, mention men of honor fenced in
Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end
Don't get keelhauled in
Villain always been, feel real genuine ballskin
Not to call the whole crowd out
It's just a few chumps, and you know who you are like a shoutout
Place 'em in your loud mouth and taste 'em like a pastry
Waste of space face hastily bow out gracefully
Disappear, reappear and disappear again
Villain not his hair, he's no afro-american
If that's the case he be a bald-headed African
Taking all the credit and jetted, astro travelling
Turn a man into a mannequin for AFLAC'n
And being tough acting Tinactin bluff jacking
He wears a mask so when he dogs his face
Each and every race, could absorb the bass
In the place to be, don't believe the hyperbole
It's like a murder spree, get sniped verbally
Or beat in the head with lead pipe languages
For street cred leave him for dead in anguishments
The slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses
Who came to help the people with they minds and they asses
You set trip and get a grip like Spalding
These walls is thin, feel genuine ballskinIf you're waiting for a parade there ain't none
Sharpen up your spirit of adventure
The fabulous gay way
Hey what's the big idea
Yeah
I have no ideas, in fact I'm quite bewildered
Now don't get gay with me
Gay, sir
I'm far from gay
Now listen and keep your shirt on
Grown men in a rubber suit
Runnin' around with a young boy
Homo
Oh shoot, get a load of that fruit
In thigh-high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit
Holy homos
Even the rats know it’s tacky
'You ever see me slippin' like that bitch, just smack me'
Posin' Chester, legs open, couldn’t stand worse
All was missin' was a bandana and a man purse
Cryin', dyin', laughin' til glands burst
Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding-ass ran first
Fixin' baby hair, messed up wavy curl
Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl
The things some people‘ll do for fame
It’s an herb, it’s a lame
It’s... a Goddamn shame
Villain willing when them cold streets call
You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs
Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty
He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry
Turn dirt to dollars like Don Henley
Ugly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy
At least monetarily terribly
MC's need therapy, it’s like a fairy spree
Hit him with a kryptonite brick
Children come and prick his dead body with a stick
Wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick
She had the tightest grip around the head of my
...Bic, now can I get my pen back
Got no enemy, got no friend, black
With the Green Goblin got the Batcave robbed
Bust in Batman’s head bobbin’, slobbin’ Robin’s knob
Y’all already got your belts on the floor so
Kick them shits over here and click off the porno
Alfred come home and found them both nekkid
Handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected
Red and chrome Batmobile, wheelin‘ and dealin’
Aquaman's sleepin' with the fishes, for real for squealin’
Pss the lo-lo on a seal skin blazer
It’s just a little graze from a razor-thin laser
Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players
Showin' off they titballs to all the free-gayers
It’s like a leotard fest
How it got started is any retards guess
Regardless, that’s they choice, no hate debate
Becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight
And raise the monster rate in the whole population
It’s starting to affect the super pimpin’ occupation
Now, who’s the hater, headline the newspaper
Fate of a fake you out caped crusader
Tied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail
Rap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail
The man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male
Sucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale
Told ‘em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt
Did it like the dirty drawls
Wet ‘em up and air it out
You got any money
What
You got any money
Man you gone crazy
Damn
Batman's gay
Bhati boysYo what's up DOOM, This is Bumpy Knuckles
Just calling to say that I'm proud of the work you been doing dog
You know this whole album and all that that you've been working on my dude
It's like, it's like a long time coming man for people to get a chance to
Look into the mind of a villain, you know like somebody who really has
A serious outlook on their craft, you know there's a lot of clowns out here
With you know, painted faces and when they take the paint off
It's just a clown with no paint on their face [DOOM laughing]
So please understand my dude I'm watching you man and I see what you doing
It's the OG man Bumpy Knuckles straight fly, aight?
My motto for 2009 is fuck everybody [DOOM laughing], aight?
So when you go on stage and you put your middle finger up to the crowd
Ask them to put it back up
And when they show respect to the villain they should say fuck everybody [DOOM laughing]
Cause that's what everybody's gonna say when they have to show respect for you
Ahh fuck him, fuck him that's the dinkest shit in the world if they write this
Well fuck you
Cause everybody wanna be what you are
You nah'mean? They can't find
Themselves
Aight, stay focused my dude I appreciate your work
Aight? Soon come: Bumpy Knuckles, MF DOOM— soon come
PeaceBorn like this, into this
As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals that are too expensive that it is cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charged so much that it is cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this, dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs
Land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that
The sun hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel boom
Revelations in Braille respiration inhale view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A Bad Samaritan averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps, perhaps road kill if that
Gift of gab and he flowed ill chrome stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines
Chief and beefing being off deep ends divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind tightly bind blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is then, listening
To sizzling officialtons whispering, "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath gave a f pay your debt they forget
Make her sweat bullets crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates
Three thousand years ago Moses said
Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still thy beast, not yet human!
You ought to let your uncle flow my motorcyle trunk fulls
From 2 1 2 1 lose crumbs to trunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans use to get
Standing around from where the translucent looses spit
Missing wheel you don't listen you're a feel head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing twitching kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catch some time in county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell you couldn't tell from 3 cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you use to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers
(Voice)
DOOM is transmitting a message to you
Super fools
I need to use more powerVillain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his goulashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
The ten case of cave a chicken chest S
Yes ya'll the dub will get ya trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub to get a nickels
But tut tut, he about to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told em "Firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still there's no thrill
Villa bill ya ten K bills in his pilla
Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with...
Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Worf, some say stronger though
Off the top Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
Or actressin' and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray J the old tape
DOOM - well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PhD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest Goes To Camp
For the right earn - na'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off SimplyLyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Sons fan base know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wicks lit
(Can you dig it?)
"We have got to try and find DOOM!"
"Good luck!"What is the magic that makes one's eyes
Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies
The name of the game is lightworks
I see you're peein' in you pants little sissy boy
Jerks...
Welcome to the Octagon
Lay a player flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon
With hard rock Black, Rock & Ron's goin' Barbizon
Curled up beggin, layin on the canvas
Instead of in the ready position like praying mantis
Scissors, Lanvis, grand fist sandwich, stance switch
Slammed on, stitches twitch, hands itch, damn snitch
Any street corner could be the platform till we defeat gone and wander
Watch your mouth jaw, southpaw, outs floor
Doubt your clout more, bout roar, outscore boy
Off the leash like UFC
Off the beat, off ya feet like two lefties
FUB's, heffer please, lost a few to stew beef
New referees, what a remarkable team, show your teeth
The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks
Wipe off slight smirks
The match was mapped out
Get jabbed and crap-slapped out, tapped out
Either the lunch bin or choke hold time
Munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme
The shine that sparkles and gleams
Light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks
The right hurtsChain-smoking beedies 'til his brain's broken completely
Get back on his feet, work out, and eat some Wheaties
Greedy for the cheese, please, most couldn't fathom
Had him in the cobra clutch when he spat the mad hymn
Gems, collection of *brrrrrrat*'s, Timbs and hats
Had no time for the pitty-pat, I'll give him that
The rhythm hit him back with a right hook
Shook it off, caught a shiner, thought it was an aight look
Depends on the shades, the end of days fades
Pretenders lay in dazes on stages, Du-malaise
Eat it up, microphone, microwave mayonnaise
His own way was strange but it matters not
Tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock
Hold it down like Shatner do Spock
Rapper jocks need to put a sock their chatterbox
The block got light of IOC stock
Folks gather round, it's no joke like "Knock, knock"
It's them, they came home to roost y'all
And watch 'em transform the game to the rules of foosball
She's too small, any questions?
Him could squeeze blood from a penny in the recession
Keep guessing, it gets deeper than depression
The power of suggestion wake a sleeper, peep the lesson
Dig that beat
Ripped it with Metal Fingers and stomped it with big fat feet
And you know what they say, cut the hay
Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated
But today it's all grey, metallic with a ruby stone
Rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on
Hardcore porn, did his own stunts
Writ his own rhymes and split his own blunts
Once in a while, every other minute
Eyes pop out, Popeye, heavy on the spinach
Steady on his business and ready with an ill pitch
Keeps a bad bilznitch like Denny Kucimilznitch
No hitch, just a shit-load of spit and sneeze
Strictly G stacking up off a rack of hidden fees
Rap is like the gay club strip tease
With hippies on the yip saying "Hey bub, grip these"
They screaming for attention
Beaming at the mention of a scary demon convention
You could cut the tension with a switchblade
And serve it on the same plate of hors d'oeuvres a witch made
Filleted, persuaded the chambermaid
To bet her paycheck on a get-naked game of spades
Straight up, no chaser, no layaways
Caution, faint taste of microwave mayonnaise
"Doom has taken over every continent"More rhymin', pure diamond, tore hymen, poor timing
Raw lining, Paul Simon touring, I'm in
Boring typing, snoring pipe when hyper than four hype men
Excited writing, trifling times ten
Long stay, songs play, gone haywire, wrong way
On the interstate, integrate all day
It's just a small phase, that's what them all say
Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway
Meant to be sold, not told to friendly enemies
Remember these intentionally, empathy please
Silent moment, violent prone atonement
Miles a minute on a microphone, own rent, loan spent
No debt, has bet, fast get, cash jet
Master McSmash, Asterix stashed it last
Not least, pass the pot of hot grease
Geese shot, not easily spotted plot, cease snot release
Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well
Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail
Get the message by bird mail or turds flail
Villain man, best nerd male you heard wail
An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannies
Before she look, he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties
Or plan B, when in Rome go back home
And get real dome from a well-known crack gnome
He talk to himself when he need someone to hate on
The black-McCain campaign, negative debate-a-thon
Gone wrong on the song, who's zooming who?
Knew it was you DOOM all along
Ever since he first started the art, it's been worth it
Soon to charter a stint on part of the Chitlin' Circuit
Word kid, get your ticket from the telepath
"Wicked, wicked, wicked" on electroencephalograph
Villain, nice to meet you
{​​*snore*}​​ You born like this?So we're gonna stand on perimeter
We did have some shots fired right down the street on us
While this was goin on, so we gotta set up a tight perimeter
We got the streets blocked off
To make sure we don't have any drivebys on us
Other than that, the operation went, fairly well...
Who told you that? Rolled through, BRRRAT
Old to the new, knows who holds the hat
Custom tailored fitted, head stayed same size
Big since first born, well spitted game wise
Same guy, same disguise, sick aim eye stare
At thick dame thighs, click claim prize
And the lucky contestant was sent
A whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement
Digital format, provide the ROM
Ride calm, flow was like a roadside bomb
Flipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing
Cameraman wig back, gunner screaming INCOMING
RPG, rhyme propelled grenade
Time to yell, scramble for cover in the shade
Bright as the midday sun, then it fade
Darkness come quick, some run and get sprayed
Rot dead, hot lead, it's rainin
Left 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin
Dragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps
Dogtag attached to explosive human booby traps
Where's air support? Ears ringin, mortars whistlin
Bloodshot vision, afterthought: abort mission
Too little too late, as the last man gush
Took no prisoners mush, rap ambush
(MURDALIZING SUCKER EMCEES~!)I'm still dope even if the bag ain't Coach
Even if I don't smoke till the hydro roach
I'm still dope, rock a thrift store coat
And a fresh pair of moccasins
Comfortable for walkin' in
No A&R marketin'
This is my reality
Still dope, power walk, burning off the calories
Fact and not fallacy, Metal Face family
Imminent fatality, taking us too casually, I--
Got it, it's cool, just
Part of the school, and I'm
Acing the lesson, it's time, so quit stressin'
Still dope, vibrant, natural game:
No ring, no chain, still bringin' the pain
Still dope, got no choice but to cope
Listen, take notes, I'm showin' you the ropes
Still dope, very high dosage
My approach is lights out, "Buenos noches."
Hold my glasses so I can get Riddick
Send 'em home tail tucked, holdin' they fitteds
Cold as a Guinness--"One pint miss!"
Yo Chill, watch the table a fish might flip!
Crack jokes spit--
Pop mad shit--
That's what it's made for, cop that quick
"Drop that, vic!" Butterfingers, oopsie
Signed away your publishing for Jordans and a loosie?
The old one-two, see; solo not groupie
All over they ass like sweats by Juicy
Cats is puss like Sagwa and Morris
Stay spittin' lines, there is no chorus
Deploying the troublesome, sleep in bubblegum:
That's a double dumb, hum if you feel where I'm comin' from
Do it till ya lips are numb, you gotta go for it
I stay moving forward; I'm baby bear porridge
Knick-nack paddywack, fuck ya'll critics
This dime on the grind when it come to the spinach
Conquered the Id, Vicious like Sid flow
Not a nympho, IMpress Official!
She rock mikes; you wait to exhale
She rock shows like DMC rock Cazals
She rock shells, manicured nails
Rock for every belle with a spliff to inhale
Holdin' she own cone of homegrown shrubbery
Won't go hungry: the flow too lovely!
Leavin' grills dented on a SUV rented
Classic as vintage Impalas that's all tinted
Raw bidness: like how them wifeys get hitted
Authentic, the track is so love, I'm all in it
Aww quit it, of course I'm inclined to shine, did-ick
Line for line wit it, climbin' infinite
¿Tu no sabe? Yo soy una bien mala madre
Confident aren't we? Playin' it smartly
Word to Dios, Estrella is lethal
Flow muy frio, roll the dice chico
Live crazy decent insanely frequent
Strangely sleep wit' one eye open not jokin', outspoken
Provokin' and chokin', ego strokin' is lame
Word bonder than James, four alarm wit' the flame
Way ahead of the game, still playing the same
Royalty in my veins, it'll always remain
Forever doin' my thing, solo or crew I can hang
Like ylang and ylang, bring the Yin to the Yang
They got placenta for brains, testing my venomous slang
Fools get fitted for bangs and rented for change
Some people think I'm deranged, others a little bit strange
Just trying to rattle my cage, cause I'm way outta they rangeLooks like I hit the jackpot! (Supervillain!)
That's the best part of all! I'm working for the biggest group of villains this world has ever known! We're led by the man himself! (The Supervillain!) [Yuh!] Doom's got a plan that's gonna shake the heavens...You wanna get tough punk?! Good! Time to get the feta!What rhymes with shillin, villain
What rhymes with shmillain, villain
He's a villain..
Yes, he is..
Set it off adrenaline rush, the boys way beyond a pen and the dutch
Stronger than hen a bag of the dust, you need to watch how they acting with us
Now time to get it in gear, get it in right here
Revenge is better than beer, Yo Doom, it's been a minute think they getting it clear (Yeah!)
When brothers reunite, make sure we party right
We rock it all night long even beyond the morning light
It's hard to see him in the light, even harder to see him on the mic
A black Benz beats being on a bike, and he can talk a gay chick outta being a dike
(New Kurious, y'all) Like that y'all, freak freak y'all (At a store near you)
To the beat y'all (Go get it)
Keep it on click fully auto, I won't stop the rock until pockets thick and gordo
More so a risk of sounding poor, bro
No tux  who needs tickets to the award show
Normally cordial, more or less, less is more or no
Hock spit out the cockpit, stuck to the window 'till it's solid as a rock hit
Yes, he is..
He grabbed the mic like two money bags
Waiting for the getaway to count what he had
Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking
The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing
Funny man gave 'em nuttin like a bummy dare
Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab
But that's the life of a villain, and you know after that, chilling
Went places got Gracie don't follow, the big joke ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle
Writing rhymes till the pen go hollow and been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow
And get the villain and scheme, if it's not real life it's still in yo' dreams
Like that y'all, like that y'all, like that a like that and like that y'all
What rhymes with thrillin, villain..
What rhymes with stealin, villain..
He's a villain..
Yes, he is..
..That's right, I'll smack the black off of ya, punk!
Villain..
Pushin' on the couch cushion, south side Minneap never lived out in Brooklyn
Kept the faith forget the fame
If they sweat the name let it set the lane
Held mind, cold and hard, had no regard who the chosen are
Who, you? Oh no, you played the Oboe, keep it on the low low
Rappers are candy butterscotch, I'mma let their baby mothers watch
She loves the ock, I touch the spot
Bitch, I'm the itch, that must've got up her crotch, heh
Now stop, fill the buildings
And leave some pills for these little villains
Hey shorty, share the flask
Let me explain why I wear this mask..
Villain!
"I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there
Gonna make sure you get cracked!"Villain!
(Thank you) Thank ya...Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share strawberry morning, gone an more important spawning
Torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions, auditioning morticians
Saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meagre fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bees knees for sheez
G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop the grease to stop diseases, gee wiz pa!
DOOM rock grandma like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a Rolling Stone star like Obama
Pull a card like oh drama
Civil liberties
These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C
Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z
What you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot-barred heart throb
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet
Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's thatLive! In stereo
Yessir! This what I wanna hear my nigga, yeah
Yeah yeah
You don't even know that's the official word up in the town
You heard? Ha ha ha
Get that swing, yessir! Get it in man
That's the official shit kid, mmhmm
Word up, we gon' take it back to the big park 'n shit
Yeah, when niggas was rhymin hard and comin crazy
Electrifying and vivid, yo
I'm like a rabbi, fresh new mag and I'm mad high
Stolen black Jag I brag fly, yeah
Yo a project thug, political gangster, starving Langston Hughes
The Jews want the crib when the God dies
I'm deadly, metaphors'll dog you while I'm in the Forbes
First 500 niggas who raw live
Yo B, the nigga Shallah, he low-key
But he O.G., half of his niggas gone or in hidin
Federallis'll sneak, police, holdin my old piece
Heard the young policeman died
58 carats of glass, the Aston
Blueberry black where I keep my ices and knives at
One of the force rawest, yo we're British aware
Who get money shoot dice in his fortress
Mocknecks and stragglers, eightball jackets the hagglers
Of the rap game, post up surprise
I want that spot, coolin with the Supervillain team
All you other playboys is twats
Niggas be down for the murder game
Run in the church, grab the rifle, put one in a nigga frame
I'm thirsty, hungry like a Somalian
Polly with them niggas with the waves in they dome like tsunami
All we do is get fresh and fuck ma
Probably yo' baby ma gave me head in Barney's while I calmly
And I got giants in armies
While we rock mean colored clothes and don divas
Yeah Chef back, some call him Louis Smith
Slash Lex Diamond and his chick sell crack
We rep bananas, beat this, legend of Stan Smith
700 dollar jeans, keepin your man distance
Yeah son, gimme your ear son
Yo yo yo, yo yo get the fuck away from the ropes man
{*beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep*}
Doom, the warning signal again
Somebody approaches!
What manner of creatures are these?
There they are again, FIRE!
"A gunshot from inside the house, forces a change of plans"
{*monster roaring*}
"A straightforward entry, has turned into what appears to be"
"A barricaded standoff"
"POLICE DEPARTMENT! COME TO THE FRONT DOOR!"
"Anything you say, cracker"
As the funky beat continues..
